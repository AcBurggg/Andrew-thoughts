            <h2>User Guide to the code found <a href="https://github.com/AcBurggg/chacha20_circuitSim" target="_blank"> here</a></h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Traverse to <code>./IO</code> directory</li>
                <li>
                    Update <code>inputs.txt</code> with your desired inputs. The default values represent the test vector found 
                    <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7539#page-9" target="_blank">here</a>.
                    Your key should be 64 hex characters long for a total of 256 bits. Your counter should be 8 hex characters long. Your nonce should be 24 hex characters long.
                    <strong>DO NOT DELETE THE START OF EACH LINE</strong> (i.e. "key: ", "counter: ", etc). Your user-inputted values should follow the same format as the example in which each set of eight hex characters has a space between it.
                    If you change the key/counter/nonce values here, you will also need to update them in the main subcircuit of chacha20.sim. If you're trying to avoid tedious work, just leave these default values.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Update line 4 of <code>inputs.txt</code> with a plaintext of your choosing. In other words, replace the <code>[hello i'm andy]</code> part with the string you'd like to encrypt. Again, do not delete the start of the line ("plaintext: ") Leave the quotation marks around your string. Your string should be 64 characters or fewer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In this same directory, run the following command <code>./run.sh</code>. Ensure that the directory now contains a file called <code>hexoutput.dat</code> and that the terminal is populated with some relevant information regarding your encrypting set-up/expected ciphertext.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Open <code>chacha20.sim</code> in circuitSim. On the subcircuit titled "main" find the ROM with the label "PLAINTEXT HERE!!". Right click it and select "load from file". Navigate to and select <code>hexoutput.dat</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ensure that simulation is enabled in the file. Scroll down and find the set of red hex displays. Start the simulation by manually shift clicking the green clock icon or by pressing Command+K. You should see the expected ciphertext values appear on these displays.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Fun Background Information</h2>
            <p>
                Chacha20 is a symmetric encryption cipher that is used to ensure confidentiality of messages over an unsecure channel. "Symmetric" just means that both encryption and decryption are performed using the same key that is known to both communicating parties (oftentimes called Alice and Bob...aka point A and point B). This key should never be shared publically (even though it is flaunted wildly in the circuitry and scripts here, don't do this in real life. This is just for education). It's been adopted by TLS and is faster than AES on devices such as mobile phones that don't have dedicated AES accelerators. I think it is pretty cool.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>chacha20.sim</code> can be opened using CS2110-CircuitSim.jar (present in this repository) - a modification of the software found 
                <a href="https://github.com/ra4king/CircuitSim" target="_blank">here</a>. It should also work with other versions of circuitSim... but no guarantees.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this file is a circuitry implementation of the chacha20 block function as described in this 
                <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7539" target="_blank">RFC document</a>.
                Note that a more broad overview can be found on the 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20#ChaCha_variant" target="_blank">Salsa20 wikipedia page</a>.
                To the best of my knowledge, the wikipedia page describes creator Daniel Bernstein's implementation while the RFC document (that I based my design on) is the IETF's modified design. This slightly altered version decreases the length of the counter from 64-bits to 32-bits and increases the length of the nonce from 64-bits to 96-bits. Only the initial matrix state changes - the logic of the block_function is unchanged.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, the "intitial state" of the input matrix is represented by 16 32-bit circuitSim constant pins at the top of the main subcircuit. The fields that can be altered are as follows: key0-key7, counter, and nonce0-2. The constant is a nothing-up-my-sleeve-number and should not be changed to maintain integriy. It is the ASCII value of "expand 32-byte k" which describes what the block function is doing. It's taking a smaller key and turning it into a large pseudorandom keystream using Add, Rotate, and XOR operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The block function's purpose is to generate a long keystream that can then be XOR'd with a plaintext input to get a ciphertext. The block function uses this counter (CTR) mode of operation just to generate the keystream. The actual encryption itself can be thought of as a stream cipher.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to generating this keystream, the main subcircuit also supports the actual encryption process of a provided plaintext string on red hex displays (process described above).
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, the circuitry is able to generate 512 bits of keystream at once meaning that strings to be encrypted should be limited to (512 / 8 bits per ascii char) 64 characters or fewer. In real life, the benefit of the CTR mode would allow 2^32 * 512 bits to be generated easily by merely incrementing the counter value and running the block function again- this functionality has not (yet) been implemented in my .sim file.
